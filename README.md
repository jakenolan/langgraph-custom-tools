# LangGraph With Custom Tools

This is example code for a LangGraph solution that uses a custom made toolkit.
LangGraph is built on top of and alongside LangChain to be a new way to make multi-agent LLM workflows.
In this example we make a notes agent that can create and query notes for a user.
This example not only makes use of custom tools but also RAG.

### To Get Started

To get started you are going to create a .env file in the same directory as these files.
Inside the .env file you will create one line (like below) to save your OpenAI API Key for reference.
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=""
```

<br />

Once that is set up, you should be ready to go. Please just confirm you have a 'notes' folder in your directory.

<br />

Enjoy and keep learning!
